All content on this site (with the exception of /self/ posts) is generated through <a href=\"https://webmention.io\">webmentions</a>.</p>\n<h2>Quick Start</h2>\n<h3>üìù New Thread</h3>\n<p>Send a webmention from your post to indieforums.net. That's it. The cleanest way to do this is an empty <code>a</code> tag with <code>class=\"u-syndication\"</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.indieforums.net/assets/img/indieforums-syndication-example.png\" alt=\"Example of syndication link\" /></p>\n<h3>‚Ü©Ô∏è Reply to a thread</h3>\n<p>Send a webmention to the URL of said thread (\"https://www.indieforums.net/threads/7de25018ef5fdcbf.html\"). You should include a reply-to webmention back to the original authors site, too. To make this easy, just click reply on any post and the links for that post will be ready for you!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.indieforums.net/assets/img/indieforums-reply-example.png\" alt=\"Example of reply\" /></p>\n<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Report a post</h3>\n<p>Click the Report link at the bottom of each post to open a new email (please leave the subject as-is). The body of the email should contain the issue you see with that post.</p>\n<h3>‚ùì I don't have a site</h3>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started\">Getting Started</a> section of the IndieWeb wiki. <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> is probably your quickest choice.</p>\n<h2>But why?</h2>\n<p>The IndieWeb is a decentralized way of interacting on the internet. Through webmentions, one site (or person, organization, etc) can tell another that it was linked to, that they replied to a post, liked a page, RSVP'd to an event, bookmarked a page, etc. You can also syndicate your post to other sites, and that is the mechanism for publishing to IndieForums. Using the IndieWeb to run a forum means the forum needs no database, usernames, passwords, forms, etc. All content is independently archived somewhere else on the internet.</p>\n<p>In my random reading about IndieWeb things, I ran across <a href=\"https://news.indieweb.org\">IndieWeb News</a>, a news aggregator built by <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com\">Aaron Parecki</a>, one of the founders of the IndieWeb. It looked like an awesome idea and I thought it would be cool to add comments and I thought \"I could build that\"...so I did!</p>\n<p>And why a forum? Who doesn't like old-school forums? You want threaded comments? Not here! Just plain old sort-by-new, single threads.</p>\n<h2>More site details</h2>\n<p>This site is statically generated every time a webmention is sent. It doesn't use any client-side javascript. It doesn't track you (well, Netlify does to some degree).</p>\n<p>This site is built using the following tools:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev\">11ty</a> to build the site</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://github.com\">Github</a> to host the repository</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://netlify.com\">Netlify</a> to host the site</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> to receive webmentions</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.indieforums.net\" class=\"u-syndication\"></a></p>",
